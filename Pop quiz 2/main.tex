\section{prove if r is a irrational (contraposition), then \sqrt{r} is irrational}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item set \math{p} as r is irrational, \math{q} as \math{\sqrt{r}} is irrational
    \item from \math{p \to q}, we can get \math{\neg q \to \neg p}, then the statement become: if \math{\sqrt{r}} is rational, then \math{r} is rational
    \item since for any rational number \math{x}, \math{{x}^2} is also a rational number. For \math{{\sqrt{r}}^2 = r}, since \math{\sqrt{r}} is a rational number, \math{r} is also a rational number. \math{\neg q \to \neg p} is true.
    \item \math{p \to q} is true
\end{enumerate}

\section{Prove (contradition) that for all integer \math{a, b, a^2-4b^2 \neq 2}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item set \math{a, b} are all possible integers as \math{p}, \math{{a}^2 - {4b}^2 \neq 2} as \math{q}
    \item to prove \math{p \to q} true, we may prove the following statement is false: \math{p \to \neg q}
    \item For all integers \math{a, b}, \math{a + b} and \math{a - b} will also be integers. In equation \math{(a-2b)(a+2b) = 2} from \math{\neg q}, \math{a-2b} and \math{a+2b} have to be integers as well
    \item \math{(1, 2), (-1, -2), (2, 1), (-2, -1)} are possible combinations, while solution of \math{a, b} in all combinations are not integers. 
    \item Since \math{a, b} can either be an integer or an non-integer. Statement \math{p \to \neg q} is false.
    \item \math{p \to q} is true
\end{enumerate}
